# C-Graphs
A little program for trying out some of the most common graph algorithms.

## Supported algorithms
* BFS
* DFS
* More comming soon

## Usage
```bash
./main [--algorithm] [file containing an adjacency matrix] [value of the start node] [value of the end node]
````
Example adjacency matrix:
```text
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 1 0 4 3 0 0 0 0
3 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 8
5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0
```
